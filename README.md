Student Profile Cards is a project made with HTML and CSS  that displays a set of student profiles from DC comics in a card-based layout. Each card includes a student's photo, name, and a short description. The core structure is built in index.html, where each student card is defined using semantic HTML elements like section, img, anchor, and h2. 

Styling is handled in styles.css, which uses Flexbox to arrange the cards responsively and applies modern design touches like shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects.
